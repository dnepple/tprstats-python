.. py:function:: pooled_std(s1, s2, n1, n2)

   Calculates the pooled standard deviation, i.e., the difference in means between two independent samples.

   :param s1: standard deviation of group 1
   :param s2: standard deviation of group 2
   :param n1: number of observations from group 1
   :param n2: number of observations from group 2

   Returns: Pooled standard deviation


.. py:function:: cohens_d(m1, m2, s1, s2, n1, n2)

   Calculates Cohen's d a.k.a. the standardized effect size.

   :param m1: mean of group 1
   :param m2: mean of group 2
   :param s1: standard deviation of group 1
   :param s2: standard deviation of group 2
   :param n1: number of observations from group 1
   :param n2: number of observations from group 2

   Returns: Cohen's d


.. py:function:: AB_nobs(diff_means, std1, std2, power, ratio=1, alpha=0.05)

   Calculates the number of observations needed for an experiment to test a difference in population means.

   :param diff_means: The difference in means.
   :param std1: standard deviation of group 1
   :param std1: standard deviation of group 1
   :param power: Desired power
   :param ratio: Ratio of nobs2/nobs1. Defaults to 1.
   :type ratio: float, optional
   :param alpha: The significance level. Defaults to 0.05.
   :type alpha: float, optional

   :returns: The number of observations for an experiment.
   :rtype: pandas.Series


.. py:function:: AB_power(diff_means, nobs1, nobs2, std1, std2, alpha=0.05)

   Calculates the power of an experiment to test a difference in population means.

   :param diff_means: The difference in means
   :param nobs1: The number of observations from population 1
   :param nobs2: The number of observations from population 2
   :param std1: The standard deviation for population 1
   :param std2: The standard deviation for population 2
   :param alpha: The significance level. Defaults to 0.05.
   :type alpha: float, optional

   Returns: Power
